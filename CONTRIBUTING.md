This repository contains solutions from the LeetCode practice sessions I conduct as part of the MDS LeetCode sessions.  
Contributions are expected to follow the existing structure strictly.

2. **Create a new branch**  
   The branch name is up to you.
```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

3. **Add your solutions**

   * Only add `.py`, `.cpp`, or `.c` files
   * Place them in the appropriate folder corresponding to the problem
   * Name the file after yourself or your GitHub username
   
   Examples:
   * `yourusername.c`
   * `yourusername.py`
   * `yourusername.cpp`

4. **Commit and push your changes**

## Contribution Rules

* Do not edit or delete existing solutions
* Do not change the folder structure
* One solution file per contributor per problem (you can add multiple solutions one after another and mention the difference in comments)
* Keep code clean, readable, and idiomatic Python

Pull requests that do not follow these rules will be closed.
